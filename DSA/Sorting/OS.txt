OOP
What is the Requirement to Create Objects in Java?
1) To store entities data temporarily in java applications we need objects.
2) To Access the members of any particular class we need objects.

2) Generating Identities for the Object:
After creating a block of memory [Object] for JVM requirements, Heap manager will
assign an integer value as an identity for the object called as "HashCode".

Constructors:
1) Constructor is a java feature; it can be used to create Object.
2) The role of the constructors in Object creation is to provide initial values inside the
object.
3) In java applications, Constructors are executed exactly at the time of creating objects,
not before creating objects and not after creating objects.
4) The main utilization of constructors is to provide initializations for class level variables
mainly instance variable.
5) Constructors must have same name of the respective class.
6) Constructors are not having return types

Instance Variables:
✽ Instance Variable is a normal Java variable, whose values will be varied from one
instance to another instance of an object.


'static' keyword:
'static' is a Java keyword, it will improve sharability in Java applications.
In Java applications, static keyword will be utilized in the following four ways.
1) Static variables
2) Static methods
3) Static blocks
4) Static import 
4) Static import
